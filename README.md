# TheDoors

Just a funny (not so much actually) game to spend a few minutes of your spare time. 
There are four doors before you; pick one and you will see one of these things behind it: 
a stairway that leads you to a higher floor, a stairway that does the opposite, 
a heart that increases your game lives, and a skull that takes your game lives. 
The goal is to make it to the ninth floor by using only your intuition. Good luck!
